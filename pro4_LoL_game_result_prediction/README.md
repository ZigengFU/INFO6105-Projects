# LoL (League of Legends) Game Result Prediction
This is the final project of INFO6105 Data Science Tools and Methods in Spring 2019 semester at Northeastern University.

## Contributers
Zigeng Fu, Hao Cui, Yimu Jin, Ziyan Zhu

## Project Overview
In this project, we will build a prediction model using MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), and use the datasets scraped from a Chinese game platform (https://www.wanplus.com/lol/) to train and test the machine learning model. Our goal is to predict the game result and its probability between a selected Chinese team and another team consists of 5 players. We will also develop a web application and deploy it on cloud.
